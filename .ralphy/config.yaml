rules:
  - After completing a PRD checklist task, immediately update PRD.md by changing
    that task from - [ ] to - [x]. Include that PRD.md change in the same commit
    as the code changes. Do not check tasks you did not complete.
  - Only mark a task complete if the related files/changes are present in git
    diff and committed. If unable to commit changes, do not check off the task.
  - Do one PRD checklist task at a time and keep diffs small.
  - Build the provider interface first; do not hardcode provider APIs in UI.
  - After each task, run the app and commit the changes.
